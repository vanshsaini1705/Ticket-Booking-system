## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Update Google Apps Script CORS

If you encounter CORS issues:

```javascript
// In your Google Apps Script
function doGet(e) {
  return HtmlService.createHtmlOutput("CORS test")
    .setXFrameOptionsMode(HtmlService.XFrameOptionsMode.ALLOWALL);
}
```

### 2. Test All Functionality

**Booking Flow Test**:
1. Visit your live site
2. Try student login with test credentials
3. Complete a booking with dummy data
4. Check Google Sheets for the entry
5. Test admin approval process
6. Verify email delivery

**Mobile Testing**:
1. Test on various screen sizes
2. Check touch interactions
3. Verify form submissions work
4. Test file upload on mobile

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Image Optimization**:
```bash
# Use tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or Squoosh
# Target file sizes:
# - Hero image: < 500KB
# - Logo: < 50KB
# - Other images: < 200KB
```

**CSS/JS Minification**:
```bash
# Optional: Use tools like UglifyJS or cssnano
# For this project, files are already optimized
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Google Analytics (Optional)

Add to `index.html` before `</head>`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_TRACKING_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_TRACKING_ID');
</script>
```

### 2. Error Monitoring

Add error tracking to `script.js`:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('error', function(e) {
  console.error('Global error:', e.error);
  // Send to your error tracking service
});
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Use browser dev tools or services like:
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables

**Sensitive data in config.js**:
- Keep Google Apps Script URL public (it's meant to be)
- Don't include actual passwords in student credentials
- Use strong, unique passwords for admin access

### 2. Input Validation

Already implemented:
- Frontend form validation
- Backend data sanitization
- File type restrictions for uploads

### 3. Rate Limiting

Consider adding rate limiting for:
- Form submissions
- File uploads
- API calls

## üö® Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Common Problems:

**1. Site loads but booking doesn't work**
```
Solution: Check Google Apps Script URL in config.js
Verify: Apps Script is deployed as Web App with correct permissions
```

**2. Images not loading**
```
Solution: Check file paths in config.js
Verify: Images exist in assets/ folder
Check: Image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
```

**3. Mobile layout broken**
```
Solution: Test viewport meta tag is present
Verify: CSS media queries are working
Check: Touch events are properly handled
```

**4. Forms not submitting**
```
Solution: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
Verify: Google Apps Script permissions
Test: Network connectivity to script URL
```

### Debug Mode:

Enable debug logging:
```javascript
// In config.js
const CONFIG = {
  debug: true, // Add this line
  // ... rest of config
};
```

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### High Traffic Preparation:

1. **Google Apps Script Limits**:
   - 6 minutes execution time per function
   - 100 concurrent executions
   - Consider upgrading to Google Cloud Functions for higher limits

2. **Google Sheets Limits**:
   - 10 million cells per spreadsheet
   - 18,278 columns maximum
   - Consider database migration for 1000+ bookings

3. **Email Limits**:
   - Gmail API: 1 billion quota units per day
   - MailApp: 100 emails per day (consumer), 1500 (workspace)
